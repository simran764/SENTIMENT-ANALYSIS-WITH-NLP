# Description
The core objective of Task 2 is to:

Understand how to process and analyze textual data.

Implement TF-IDF to convert text into feature vectors.

Use Logistic Regression to classify sentiments.

Evaluate model performance through appropriate metrics.

Deliver results in a well-documented Jupyter Notebook.

This task simulates real-world scenarios where companies want to analyze customer feedback automatically for improving services, marketing strategies, or product quality.

Key Concepts
Sentiment Analysis:
Sentiment analysis is a text classification technique that determines whether a piece of writing is positive, negative, or neutral. It's widely used in applications like product reviews, social media monitoring, and customer service.

TF-IDF Vectorization:
TF-IDF is a method to convert textual data into numeric form by calculating the importance of words in a document relative to a corpus. It helps retain meaningful words while reducing the impact of frequently occurring but less informative words like “the,” “is,” etc.

Logistic Regression:
Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for binary and multi-class classification. It calculates the probability that an input belongs to a particular category, making it highly suitable for sentiment analysis tasks.

Implementation Steps
Import Libraries:
Begin by importing essential libraries like pandas, numpy, sklearn, and matplotlib/seaborn. You may also use nltk or spaCy for advanced text preprocessing.

Load Dataset:
Use customer review datasets such as Amazon product reviews, Yelp reviews, or Twitter sentiment datasets. These can be found on platforms like Kaggle, UCI ML Repository, or GitHub.

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Remove special characters, numbers, and punctuation.

Convert text to lowercase.

Remove stopwords and perform lemmatization/stemming if needed.

Tokenize the text (break into words or terms).

Vectorization:
Apply TF-IDF using Scikit-learn’s TfidfVectorizer to transform the text into feature vectors. Set parameters such as max_features to limit vocabulary size or ngram_range to consider word pairs/trigrams.

Train-Test Split:
Divide the dataset into training and test sets using train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection.

Model Training:
Use LogisticRegression from Scikit-learn. Fit the model on the TF-IDF vectors of training data and train it to recognize sentiment patterns.

Prediction and Evaluation:
Use the trained model to predict the sentiment of the test set. Evaluate model performance using:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, F1-Score

Confusion Matrix

Optional: ROC-AUC score for binary classification

Visualization:
Include plots such as:

Confusion matrix heatmaps

Distribution of predicted sentiment

Word clouds for positive and negative sentiments

Deliverables
The output should be a Jupyter Notebook that includes:

Data loading and cleaning process

Implementation of TF-IDF vectorization

Model training and evaluation

Visualizations and insights drawn from model results

All code should be well-commented and supported by markdown cells explaining the process, logic, and interpretation of results.
